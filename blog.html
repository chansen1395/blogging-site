          Zoinks, rad-lads! That Board-Mangler KO'd me so hard! Instead of shredding
          waves on Friday, the waves shredded my board! So gnarly. Lookin' to hop back
          on the ol' horse soon and get some tubular action!

          all over the place on Big Blue today! Totally siiiiick! My new board has a
          picture of a lizard on it. Does anyone know what type of lizard it it? Let
          me know! Shoot me an email

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hey there surf-heads, I'm just a cool surfer who loves whackin' the waves!
      My favorite food is salt-water, and my favorite color is blue. I like
      long walks on the beach with my surfboard Sven.
      <br>Here's a link to my
      <a href="surferdude86@surftown.gov">e-mail</a>
      for all you rad folks out there! Let's surf! YEAH!
