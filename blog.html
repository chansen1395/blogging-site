          Zoinks, rad-lads! That Board-Mangler KO'd me so hard! Instead of shredding
          waves on Friday, the waves shredded my board! So gnarly. Lookin' to hop back
          on the ol' horse soon and get some tubular action!

      My favorite food is salt-water, and my favorite color is blue. I like 
      long walks on the beach with my surfboard Sven. 
      <br>Here's a link to my 
      <a href="surferdude86@surftown.gov">e-mail</a>
